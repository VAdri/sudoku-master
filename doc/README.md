Converts a string into a sudoku grid.

The string can contain only big numbers (digits), in which case the empty
cells must be marked with one of these symbols: ".", "-", "\*", "0"; or it
can also contain the little numbers (or candidates), in which case they
need to be grouped (using brackets around them or putting spaces between
them for instance) in order to be able to differentiate each cell.

The grid can be organized in a single line, in multiple lines or as a grid
(with symbols representing the grid lines). The regular expressions used to
validate these formats are exported in constants prefixed with "PATTERN\_".

### Parameters

-   `stringGrid` **[string][6]** The string representing a sudoku grid.

### Examples

```javascript
const grid = parseGrid(`
   +---+---+---+
   |*23|4**|8**|
   |6**|**7|***|
   |***|53*|62*|
   +---+---+---+
   |**5|***|***|
   |84*|***|*36|
   |***|***|1**|
   +---+---+---+
   |*52|*96|***|
   |***|1**|**7|
   |**8|**5|21*|
   +---+---+---+
 `);
```

Returns **(SudokuGrid | null)** The `SudokuGrid` that was parsed, or `null`
if the given string was not in a valid format.
